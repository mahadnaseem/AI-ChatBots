Welcome to the AI Chatbot project repository! This repository contains the source code and resources for an AI chatbot developed using Python, Langchain, and Huggingface libraries. This chatbot is designed to engage in conversations with users, providing responses based on the provided PDFs by the user. The project is completely developed by using an LLM.

Features:

- Response Generation: Leveraging pre-trained language models from Huggingface, the chatbot generates contextually relevant responses to user queries.
- Langchain Integration: Langchain is used for connecting the HuggingFace language model to sources of context and prompts provided by user.
- FAISS: FAISS is used for storing vectorized embeddings.
